SHOW examples with output:\n```javascript\n// Create a student object\nlet student = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 20,\n  marks: 90\n};\n\n// Print the student's name and marks\nconsole.log(student.name);  // prints: John\nconsole.log(student.marks);  // prints: 90\n```\n\nYour task: Create a file called test.js, write a student object with any name, age, and marks you want, then print the student's name and marks with console.log.

It's a simple application that helps you manage a group of students.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you might store a student's information in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n// Create an object to store student information\nlet student = {\n  name: \"John Doe\",\n  age: 15,\n  marks: 85\n};\n\n// Print the student's information\nconsole.log(student);\n```\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  name: 'John Doe',\n  age: 15,\n  marks: 85\n}\n```\n\nNow, create a file called `students.js` and write a `console.log` statement that prints your own name and age.
